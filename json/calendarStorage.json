I live in Orlando so know the area quite well. One garage is open on the West Side but there still can be a back up and traffic getting in and out. The East Side has No Parking except behind the Hess gas station which is 1/2 mile from the entrance. Also, you need to cross a very busy street that has a cross walk and light that can take up to 5 minutes or more to activate. If you do not mind walking a mile or more and waiting to get across a busy road, then Down Town Disney East Side is the place to go. I will wait for all the construction to finish next year before going back to see if anything has improved. If you are on vacation and really need to go someplace to shop, I would try the Premium Outlet and Mall both off I-4 with plenty of parking and even a Disney Outlet store with great discounts.

Even worse, my guests had to serve themselves for cake/dessert and had to ask if there was coffee/tea available. For the price I paid, I expected a much better dining experience. The staff was too focused on making sure certain guests kept ordering alcoholic beverages, but the drinks that came with the meals (coffee, tea, soft drinks) was not offered/served.

Spent thousands of dollars, and ended the evening very disappointed. The wait staff were not attentive to detail. The main entrée was served semi warm. I was expecting a hot meal, not warm. Crème brulee came with the meal and its portion size was so ridiculous. Its more of a sample size. the top layer wasn't caramelized. It tasted like vanilla pudding with only 3 bites in the tiny cup.  Even worse, my guests had to serve themselves for cake/dessert and had to ask if there was coffee/tea available. For the price I paid, I expected a much better dining experience. The staff was too focused on making sure certain guests kept ordering alcoholic beverages, but the drinks that came with the meals (coffee, tea, soft drinks) was not offered/served.

The Nixon administration (RMN) , while causing irreparable damage to the Presidency and our election process (Watergate) did some remarkable good in the fields of social & environmental welfare, let alone the far sightedness to begin talks with China.   \n\n RMN began the negative income tax to support the working poor,  he established both OSHA (Occupational, Safety & Health Admin),   the EPA (Environmental Protection Agency) and the Endangered Species Act.       Sadly, the Nixon Library remains transfixed on reforming RMN (a Republican that was more rooted in the needs of the individual without rewarding the excesses of corporate interests and equally concerned about trying negotiation before bombs - China policy)  as a modern Reagan style Republican (who are deeply interested in tearing down environmental policies and Governmental policies promoting the greater good and promoting large corporate interests and producing 'pre-emptive wars to prevent wars).\n\nMore time would be better spent by the Library staff in giving equal exposure to all sides of this very complex man.   But, by doing so, by presenting RMN's social concerns and actions, RMN would likely come across as a 'liberal'  by the standards post Reagan and GW Bush.   \n\nSo, history takes a back seat at this Library to the needs of politics.

There was just one problem, the air-conditioning temperature was set so cold that we were thoroughly chilled by the time we left the facility.  I am not sure exactly why they had it set to be so cold but it was almost unbearable.  We have been in many other temperature controlled museums and they did not have the temperature set to be so cold...Please warm it up a few degrees so us folks from the desert of Arizona can enjoy it more and not have to shiver all the way through the museum.  It was a very education facility and very well done.  A couple of things we did notice was the putting of green print on a green background made it difficult to read.  Also, having print directly under glass was also very difficult to read.  All in all, we thoroughly enjoyed ourselves.  After all, we spent nearly four and a half hours perusing all of the material that was on display.  On the down side though, it was unfortunate that the helicopter was not open for viewing today as they were short one docent and did not have enough staff to handle opening of the helicopter.

My safe was broken so there was no way to lock up my valuables in the room.  BE VERY CAREFUL at this resort.   And do not let the friendly atmosphere and staff think you are in a safe place.","time":1409891550}],"scope":"GOOGLE","types":["lodging","point_of_interest","establishment"],"url":"https://plus.google.com/105114937078601055950/about?hl=en-US","user_ratings_total":59,"utc_offset":-420,"vicinity":"1

Unfortunately, I cannot express this enough. The ambience of this place is great and the the food is ok. \n\nHowever, my main issue with this place is the horrible customer service.  Somehow the staff managed to \"misplace\" my Visa Check card (the area I was sitting in required that you put a card down). It was missing, gone, vanished into thin air!!!! I was told that the rolodex that held all of the cards was dropped and they assured me that they would look for it at the end of the evening and that I would have a call from the General Manager the next morning. \n\nUnfortunately, this saga doesn't end there. Sadly, my banks lost/stolen line was closed, since it was about 10pm when I was told my card was lost, so I could not shut down my card. I awoke the next morning to see fraudulent charges for what I can only assume was someone's brunch in Manhattan Beach. \n\nI subsequently called my bank to shut off my card and then immediately following called The Federal Bar to inform them that my card did not just fall on to the ground of their restaurant, but that in fact it was in the hands of someone who was making charges in Manhattan Beach. Since I never received a call from their General Manager, I had to speak to the morning shift girl manager who was less than apologetic. \"Sorry ma'am. All I really could do is comp your meal.\"  I stated that this whole situation made me question the credibility of their staff as it seemed odd to me that there were absolutely no charges made on my card for the rest of the night and not until the following morning. The manager then proceeded to start ARGUING with me and stated that she \"knows the integrity of her staff!!\" Right, the \"integrity\" of the staff that lost a customer's bank card!!!! Way to show such great \"integrity\" by making a bad situation with a customer, even worse. \n\nDo not go to this establishment.

Unfortunately, I cannot express this enough. The ambience of this place is great and the the food is ok. \n\nHowever, my main issue with this place is the horrible customer service.  Somehow the staff managed to \"misplace\" my Visa Check card (the area I was sitting in required that you put a card down). It was missing, gone, vanished into thin air!!!! I was told that the rolodex that held all of the cards was dropped and they assured me that they would look for it at the end of the evening and that I would have a call from the General Manager the next morning. \n\nUnfortunately, this saga doesn't end there. Sadly, my banks lost/stolen line was closed, since it was about 10pm when I was told my card was lost, so I could not shut down my card. I awoke the next morning to see fraudulent charges for what I can only assume was someone's brunch in Manhattan Beach. \n\nI subsequently called my bank to shut off my card and then immediately following called The Federal Bar to inform them that my card did not just fall on to the ground of their restaurant, but that in fact it was in the hands of someone who was making charges in Manhattan Beach. Since I never received a call from their General Manager, I had to speak to the morning shift girl manager who was less than apologetic. \"Sorry ma'am. All I really could do is comp your meal.\"  I stated that this whole situation made me question the credibility of their staff as it seemed odd to me that there were absolutely no charges made on my card for the rest of the night and not until the following morning. The manager then proceeded to start ARGUING with me and stated that she \"knows the integrity of her staff!!\" Right, the \"integrity\" of the staff that lost a customer's bank card!!!! Way to show such great \"integrity\" by making a bad situation with a customer, even worse. \n\nDo not go to this establishment.

While they say they provide butler service, it is really a scam for them to steal from you.  I left my wallet, jewelry and some clothes in my room.  When I reported that I inadvertently left the items, I was told there was no way I could have left the items as the maid would have brought them directly to the loss prevention office.  After repeated attempts to try and get updates on  my missing items with no success, I had to file a police report.  I was told later by the St. Regis loss prevention team that they work quite a bit with the Dana Point Police on incidents like mine.  Not a good feeling, as it seems they keep the staff that is stealing and do not turn them over to the police.  They later supposedly found the missing items minus $360 in cash, and sent the items to me but at the wrong address.  When I tried to verify that they sent it to the right address, they told me to contact FedEx vs telling me they sent it to the wrong address.  Pitiful customer service.\n\nThe next day my credit card had a cash advance of $570 withdrawn from it.  In addition, the thief tried to use my debit card.  Do not get lulled into thinking this is a nice resort where they screen their employees before hiring them.  It seems the loss prevention team is in cahoots with the service staff.    My safe was broken so there was no way to lock up my valuables in the room.  BE VERY CAREFUL at this resort.   And do not let the friendly atmosphere and staff think you are in a safe

While they say they provide butler service, it is really a scam for them to steal from you.  I left my wallet, jewelry and some clothes in my room.  When I reported that I inadvertently left the items, I was told there was no way I could have left the items as the maid would have brought them directly to the loss prevention office.  After repeated attempts to try and get updates on  my missing items with no success, I had to file a police report.  I was told later by the St. Regis loss prevention team that they work quite a bit with the Dana Point Police on incidents like mine.  Not a good feeling, as it seems they keep the staff that is stealing and do not turn them over to the police.  They later supposedly found the missing items minus $360 in cash, and sent the items to me but at the wrong address.  When I tried to verify that they sent it to the right address, they told me to contact FedEx vs telling me they sent it to the wrong address.  Pitiful customer service.\n\nThe next day my credit card had a cash advance of $570 withdrawn from it.  In addition, the thief tried to use my debit card.  Do not get lulled into thinking this is a nice resort where they screen their employees before hiring them.  It seems the loss prevention team is in cahoots with the service staff.    My safe was broken so there was no way to lock up my valuables in the room.  BE VERY CAREFUL at this resort.   And do not let the friendly atmosphere and staff think you are in a safe place.","time":1409891550}],"scope":"GOOGLE","types":["lodging","point_of_interest","establishment"],"url":"https://plus.google.com/105114937078601055950/about?hl=en-US","user_ratings_total":59,"utc_offset":-420,"vicinity":"1

The whiskey selection here is decent. So I ordered a few premium scotch whiskeys. Unfortunately a couple of my drinks were stale, as they did not match the typical flavor profile for the ordered whiskeys. This was likely do to low turnover on the bottles from which I ordered, for this I do not fault the establishment. They cannot control what people order and at what pace. \nI do however fault them for  their poor bar tending practices. When I got my check I noticed that my drinks were rang up at a 50% premium compared to my friend's, even though we had ordered the same drinks. The only difference was that he had ordered on the rocks where as I did not. I inquired and was told that neat drinks include an extra .5 oz of alcohol for which I was charged, and standard drinks include only 1 oz of alcohol. This practice makes the already exorbitant prices here even more outrageous.\nOn the note of exorbitant prices, I do understand that it is the establishments right to assign such prices as they see fit, but I usually only expect such prices of a higher end establishment, which this is not. Somewhere around my second drink they cleared part of the dining area to make room for a DJ, he started to play progressives house music which I thought was out of place until a mob of unruly patrons saw it fit to start dancing. I want sure if I was in a restaurant, a bar, a club, or possibly a dive. I do know it was unreasonably loud and stuffy. I obliviously left. \n ","time":1440301998},{"aspects":[{"rating":3,"type":"overall"}],"author_name":"Mike Castro","author_url":"https://plus.google.com/107325575251073105070","language":"en","rating":5,"text":"Happy Hour!

This restaurant is a hot spot and seems like it's always packed, so book reservations. My first visit here was during dinner time and luckily they were offering a special GroupOn at the time, $28.75 for $50 worth of food & drink during dinner on Friday or Saturday. Good deal I must say!\n\nThe atmosphere is welcoming but can be a bit busy with people crowding the front of the restaurant and by the bar area. My friend and I were seated by the window at a high table. Service was exceptional that night. Since I wasn't familiar on the layout of the menu, the server explained the how the menu is constantly changing. \n\nAppetizers:\n- Birds Nest & Scalloped Dish (forget the name sadly):\nThe Birds Nest was simple, light but refreshing. The flavors went well together.\n\nEntrees:\n- Beef Tip wrapped with Bacon with Mashed Potatoes: \nThe dish was prepared perfectly. The pairing of the Chanson (Pinor) was paired nicely with the Beef Tips. It just brought out the flavors of the dish.\n\nDessert:\n- Chocolate Banana Bread with Bacon and Lime & Coconut Sorbet:\nMy friend had the Chocolate Banana Bread. The dessert was a bit rich for my taste, but don't get me it's good just not for me. I prefer a dessert with zest and lighter. The sorbet was delicious. I didn't even want to share ha. \n\nOverall experience of the Chapter One was awesome. I have been back since my first visit for a quick drink with friends. Their Moscow Mule is amazing!

Unfortunately, I cannot express this enough. The ambience of this place is great and the the food is ok. \n\nHowever, my main issue with this place is the horrible customer service.  Somehow the staff managed to \"misplace\" my Visa Check card (the area I was sitting in required that you put a card down). It was missing, gone, vanished into thin air!!!! I was told that the rolodex that held all of the cards was dropped and they assured me that they would look for it at the end of the evening and that I would have a call from the General Manager the next morning. \n\nUnfortunately, this saga doesn't end there. Sadly, my banks lost/stolen line was closed, since it was about 10pm when I was told my card was lost, so I could not shut down my card. I awoke the next morning to see fraudulent charges for what I can only assume was someone's brunch in Manhattan Beach. \n\nI subsequently called my bank to shut off my card and then immediately following called The Federal Bar to inform them that my card did not just fall on to the ground of their restaurant, but that in fact it was in the hands of someone who was making charges in Manhattan Beach. Since I never received a call from their General Manager, I had to speak to the morning shift girl manager who was less than apologetic. \"Sorry ma'am. All I really could do is comp your meal.\"  I stated that this whole situation made me question the credibility of their staff as it seemed odd to me that there were absolutely no charges made on my card for the rest of the night and not until the following morning. The manager then proceeded to start ARGUING with me and stated that she \"knows the integrity of her staff!!\" Right, the \"integrity\" of the staff that lost a customer's bank card!!!! Way to show such great \"integrity\" by making a bad situation with a customer, even worse. \n\nDo not go to this establishment.

At 1st we were waiting on the funds now that the school has the funds we are waiting on the FDA, we have been waiting for over 2 years this is very frustrating.  We aren't even being kept up on with this might turn into a possibility.  We have been dreaming for many many years for an opportunity that might husband just might be able to see now that we've been given a chance for a dream to possibility come true we're still having to wait.  My husband has missed out on his entire life since this dreaded disease has taken his eyesight slowly for all of his life.  It was discovered around 5 years of age he was having difficulty with his eyesight but there was not even a name given to it yet.  He has lost out on doing all the things a child does, a teenager, a young adult, a young married adult, a middle aged adult & now and older gent.  None of this is fair in my eyes, I'm his wife of 41 years now & even though I have my eyes it's like being in a prison, because I've never been able to enjoy him & myselves life because of this horrible disease.  We are childless because of this disease neither one of us wanted to bring a blind child into the world, it's hard enough with a blind husband.  Please FDA at least I'd like to spend the later years with my seeing husband if this is possible.  We've heard in Europe this same research has been done on people with the same disease for a man who was almost totally blind now able to drive with 20-40 vision.  So FDA you see this is extremely hard to sit this out I'm in my 60's now and my husband in his 70's please let us enjoy each other in our old age we did the best we could until now.  Now there's is a chance and you know what they say when you get older you lose all your patience.   I give the school 5 stars for their effort they are making to do this research, I give the FDA no stars for dragging their feet.","time":1435014320},{"aspects":[{"rating":3,"type":"overall"}],"author_name":"Alamara Munshi","author_url":"https://plus.google.com/117606135860789029419","language":"en","rating":5,"text":"My son Lewis Munshi  is currently studying Engineering.
